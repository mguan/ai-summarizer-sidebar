# AI Summarizer Sidebar

**Frustrated with AI slop, ads, and misinformation on the web?** Use this free, open-source Chrome extension to cut through the noise, get to the point, and call out BS.

> **Free • Open Source • Private • No Sign-up or API Key Required**

## Installation (2 Mins)

1.  **[Download the latest release Source code
(zip)](https://github.com/mguan/ai-summarizer-sidebar/releases)** and unzip.
2.  Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3.  Click **Load unpacked**, select the unzipped folder, and pin the extension.

## Usage

1.  **Open the Side Panel** by clicking the extension icon.
2.  **Navigate to any webpage** and the extension will send the prompt based on the URL pattern and get the response.

## Key Features & Privacy

*   **Zero Tracking**: The extension runs entirely on your device and collects **no data**.
*   **No API Keys**: Works with your existing logged-in accounts (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok).
*   **Works with Text & Video**: Analyzes both articles and YouTube videos (especially effective with Gemini).
*   **Customizable**: Right-click the icon -> **Options** to set custom prompts or change your default AI provider.

## Is there a catch?

The catch is that while it's free now, I might create a paid version with extra features in the future.

## Troubleshooting

*   If the AI doesn't load, ensure you are logged into that provider in a normal tab.
*   If the prompt doesn't inject, try refreshing the page.
