# AI Summarizer Sidebar

**Frustrated with AI slop, ads, and misinformation on the web?** Use this Chrome extension to cut through the noise, get to the point, and call out BS.

> **Free • Open Source • Private • No Sign-up or API Key Required**

## Installation (2 Mins)

1.  Download the latest release [Source code (zip)](https://github.com/mguan/ai-summarizer-sidebar/releases) and unzip.
2.  Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3.  Click **Load unpacked**, select the unzipped folder, and pin the extension.

## Usage

1.  Open the Side Panel by clicking the extension icon.
2.  Navigate to any webpage. The extension constructs a prompt. If the URL is configured, it automatically sends the prompt and gets the response.

## Key Features & Privacy

*   **Zero Tracking**: Runs entirely on your device with **no data collection**. The prompt and URL are sent to your AI provider only when summarizing.
*   **No API Keys**: Works with your existing logged-in accounts (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok).
*   **Works with Text & Video**: Analyzes both articles and YouTube videos (especially effective with Gemini).
*   **Customizable**: Right-click the icon -> **Options** to set custom prompts or change your default AI provider.

## Is there a catch?

Free for now. Paid features may be added later.

## Troubleshooting

*   **AI doesn't load**: Ensure you are logged into that provider in a normal tab.
*   **Prompt doesn't inject**: Try refreshing the page.
